# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Hid the Live TV and Music sections behind compile-time `FeatureFlags` (default off). The sidebar sections, settings rows, music home shelves, and music search results no longer appear. All code and SwiftData models stay in place, so on-disk stores remain valid and the features can be re-enabled by flipping a flag.

## 1.0.0 (Build 48)

- Added Discover + Watchlist tabs
- Added Music browsing
- Added pre-play audio and subtitle track pickers
- Added "Resume or Restart Prompt" setting (off by default)
- Bare touchpad tap surfaces the timeline overlay
- Fixed focus on player error screens
- Auto-transcodes codecs Apple TV can't decode (MPEG-2, VC-1, VP9, AV1)
- Fixed freeze when resuming after a paused scrub
- Fixed audio flutter on AAC, FLAC, and PCM tracks
- Fixed 401s on multi-server Plex accounts
- Each install gets its own Plex Dashboard identity

Thanks to @rrgomes for PR contributions in this release.

## 1.0.0 (Build 43)

- Refined the GUI to be more Apple TV+ esque
- Removed MPVKit. Defaulting to AVPlayer while I continue working on custom player (sorry, this means direct stream for now)
